# Usage

Lattice matching is done by the function scan_composite_combinations(), which transforms and compares two matrices.
The set of candidates is controled by NSearch and tol. Selection is based on the user-defined deformation limit. 

The script has built in the example of ZnO/Cu with parameters that identify the 4x4/3x3 match. 

The output file results_explored_matrices.txt contains the list of combinations found from the scan. 
If you find no matches for your system, you can consider adjusting the parameters in the script.
